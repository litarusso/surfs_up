# Surfs_up

## Overview of the Analysis

This analysis aims to find out if Oahu is the perfect place for our Ice Cream shop. For that reason, I tried to analyze the area's weather conditions. To do so, I looked at the months of June and December from 2010 to 2017. I researched those dates because I wanted to see if Oahu has relatively cold and relatively warm months. Understanding this temperature difference is essential for our future Ice Cream shop. In addition, I wanted to know if the weather is ideal for surfing for most of the year. I analyzed those months because I wanted to check the temperature of a summer month and a winter month; I also wanted to check the difference between six months. 

In the tables below, you can see temperatures for June and December.

##Results

There are some key differences between those two months:
- The average temperature for June is 74.9 F, while the average for December is 71 F. 
- The minimum temperature for June is 64 F, while the minimum for December is 56 F.
- The maximum temperature for June is 85 F, and the maximum for December is 83 F. 

##Summary

Table 4

We can see from the tables below that both months are suitable for surfing and swimming. I did a little research on the Internet and found that According to "Men's Journal" (mensjournal.com), winter surfing is possible even when the temperature is as cold as 50 F with a good wetsuit. 

After my analysis, I find out that Oahu is a good place for an Ice Cream shop, as it is possible to surf almost all year long.
