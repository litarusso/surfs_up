## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to find out if Oahu is the perfect place for our Ice Cream shop. For that reason I tried to analise the wheather condition of the place. In order to do so, I looked at the month of June and the month of December for from 2010 to 2017. I analyzed those dates because, I wanted to see if there are relatively cold and relatively warm months in Oahu, to understand this temperature difference is important for the future Ice Cream shop. I wanted to understand if the weather is ideal for surfing and swimming for the most of the year.
