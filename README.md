# Surfs_up


## Overview of the Analysis

This analysis aims to find out if Oahu is the perfect place for our Ice Cream shop. For that reason, I tried to analyze the area's weather conditions. To do so, I looked at the months of June and December from 2010 to 2017. I researched those dates because I wanted to see if Oahu has relatively cold and relatively warm months. Understanding this temperature difference is essential for our future Ice Cream shop. In addition, I wanted to know if the weather is ideal for surfing for most of the year. I analyzed those months because I wanted to check the temperature of a summer month and a winter month; I also wanted to check the difference between six months. 

In the tables below, you can see temperatures for June and December.

We can see from the tables below that both months are suitable for surfing and swimming. I did a little research on the Internet and found that According to "Men's Journal" (mensjournal.com), winter surfing is possible even when the temperature is as cold as 50 F with a good wetsuit. 

After my analysis, I find out that Oahu is a good place for an Ice Cream shop, as it is possible to surf almost all year long.
