# Surfs_up

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to find out if Oahu is the perfect place for our Ice Cream shop. For that reason I tried to analise the wheather condition of the place. In order to do so, I looked at the month of June and the month of December for from 2010 to 2017. I analyzed those dates because, I wanted to see if there are relatively cold and relatively warm months in Oahu, to understand this temperature difference is important for the future Ice Cream shop. I wanted to understand if the weather is ideal for surfing and swimming for the most of the year. I analyzed those months because I wanted to check the weather of a summer month and a winter month, I also wanted to check a difference of six months. 

In the tables below you can see temperatures for the months of June and December.

We can see from the tables below that both of the months are good fpr surfing and swimming. According to Men's Journal (mensjournal.com) winter surfing is possible even when the temperature is as cold as 50 F with a good wetsuit. After my analysis, we can conclude that Oahu is a good place for an Ice Cream shop, as it is possible to surf almost all year long.
